## Brief

Starters are a great way to quickly and easily bootstrap a new application. If you find yourself constantly going through the same steps each time you create a new project, a Starter can help eliminate those steps and get you moving faster.

## Level 1

At it’s core, a Starter is simply a project using the framework of your choice that you clone to use. Getting started with creating a new Starter is as simple as creating a new project.

Create a new Next.js app with its own repository on Github.

## Level 2

Usually when someone uses a Starter, it’s because it offers something out of the box that the default doesn’t provide. Since we’re building a blog, we want to have pages for that blog out of the box.

Add a blog list and blog post page that automatically creates new pages based on static content.

## Level 3

If we’re managing a blog, it’s useful to be able to manage it through a CMS instead of editing raw files. We can provide an easy way for someone to get started with a CMS service with this starter.

Configure the Starter to work out of the box after simple setup with a custom CMS.
