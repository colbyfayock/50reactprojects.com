## Brief

Surveying groups of people is a good way to understand more about that group of people, whether it’s how they feel about a certain topic or what their favorite tech is. This is useful research for gauging product development or trying to find pain points in existing products.

## Level 1

We want to find out what tools the React community uses to see if there is a pattern in usage. This can help us see if there is a gap in tools that we could build a new product for.

Create a survey that gives a multiple choice group of questions with a comment field to find out people’s favorite React tools.

## Level 2

Often a single survey isn’t enough. Knowing about the tooling is helpful, but maybe we don’t understand the types of jobs people have where they use those tools.

Create a survey manager that lets you dynamically create and manage new surveys.

## Level 3

Once the surveys are in, we end up with a lot of data about the questions we asked, but how do we consume that?

Create a dashboard of metrics that show trends determined for the group of surveys.
