# Conference Schedule

Create a <strong className="color-blue">website</strong> with speakers and a schedule for a <strong className="color-purple">React conference</strong>.

</ProjectHeader>

## Brief

The organizers of a new React conference are looking for a website that breaks down all of the information for their event. This is important, because it helps to get people interested in the event, but also figure out how to actually enjoy the event.

## Level 1

Before anything else, people need to know about the event. Where is it? What day is it? Where can people sleep?

Create a multi-page website that includes all of the basic information about the new conference. The basic information should include details like the name of the event, a description, the date, the location, food options, hotel options, and importantly a code of conduct.

## Level 2

People can now find out about the event, but who is going to speak at the event and what are they going to talk about?

Add a list of speakers to the homepage and create a schedule that lists each speaker with a talk and time.

## Level 3

Managing a little content isn’t too bad in the code, but what if the conference organizers want to make a text change? They shouldn’t have to or might not be able to check out the code and make the change.

Set up a content management system (CMS) and source the content of the website with that system.
