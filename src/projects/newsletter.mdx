## Brief

Email is a great way to communicate with others. Newsletters are a tool that let you communicate with others on a larger scale. If you’re working on something you think people should know about it, a newsletter is a great way to show them.

## Level 1

While you can create your own mail system, there are already a lot of great tools that you can use free like Converkit and Mailchimp. These tools let you set up your own subscriber list and send out emails to them all with an easy-to-use UI.

Create an account with a newsletter service of your choice.

## Level 2

In order to get subscribers to your newsletter, you need a way for them to sign up. Most platforms provide a way to create a signup form or landing page to make that happen.

Create a signup form that people can use to sign up for your newsletter. If it’s only the form, embed it on your website.

## Level 3

When sending a newsletter, services come with some default templates, but they’re not personalized for you.

Create a new template for your newsletter that you can use on your first email.
