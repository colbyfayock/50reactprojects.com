</ProjectHeader>

<ProjectContent>

## Brief

Mad Libs is a game created in the 1950’s where you have a story or phrase that’s missing words. These missing words have categories associated with them whether the type of word or topic.

## Level 1

The basis of Mad Libs is having the story to start off with. With the story, we can replace some words with empty spots for the player to fill in.

Create a story template with select words replaced with text inputs that specify a category of word to add.

## Level 2

Having only one story means the game is going to stop pretty quickly. We would want to have multiple stories where we can save the answers for each one.

Create a few more stories and the ability to save and reset the answers to each story.

## Level 3

The fun with Mad Libs comes when you can read the story out loud and hear how crazy it turned out. Why not let someone share their laughs with the world?

Add the ability to share a saved story with a link.
