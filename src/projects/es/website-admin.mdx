# Website Admin

Create an <strong className="color-blue">admin dashboard</strong> to configure <strong className="color-purple">website settings</strong> that requires user login.

</ProjectHeader>

## Brief

Having to push out code every time you want to make a configuration change is time-consuming and risky. Instead,  admin dashboards allow you to provide an authenticated way of making changes on the fly.

## Level 1

Providing the ability to make changes to a website on the fly can be risky if it’s not safe and secure behind authentication.

Create a page on a website that requires authentication to access the content.

<LoginRequired>

## Level 2

In order to make any kind of changes in a dashboard, there needs to be a part of the site that’s configurable.

Configure part of the site to be dynamic based on a setting that can be updated. (Ex: analytics ID, some text)

## Level 3

Once a website or app feature is dynamic based on configuration, we can set up a mechanism to change it.

Create a form in the admin dashboard that updates the configuration of a feature.
