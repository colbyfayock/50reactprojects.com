## Brief

Gathering inspiration for a project can get messy if you’re just using a folder on your computer. Also, which folder are you using? The one on the Desktop or the one in Documents? Mood boards are a great way to keep those pieces of inspiration and thoughts organized in one place.

## Level 1

Mood boards are generally made up of the ability to add a bunch of images in one place. Kind of like creating your own Pinterest board, but more focused.

Create a webpage that has a gallery of images.

## Level 2

Sometimes images don’t communicate the entire story. Often you’ll see mood boards have the ability to add notes or a comment, whether attached to an image or as part of the mood board itself.

Add the ability to attach a note to an image or add a note to the mood board.

## Level 3

Every time we want to add an image or a note, we don’t want to have to manually update code, it’s helpful to have an management UI and even a way to reorder.

Add a content management system to manage the images and notes. Bonus: add the ability to rearrange each item.
