Create a <strong className="color-blue">bookmark manager</strong> that allows you to store <strong className="color-purple">website links</strong> for later.

</ProjectHeader>

## Brief

Having a way to store your bookmarks means there’s a better chance you’re going to actually look at those bookmarks in the future. More often than not, we’re left with the browser bookmarks manager that ends up getting full and forgotten.

## Level 1

An easy way to view and use bookmarks is by having a webpage where you can see all of the links in some logical grouping and have the ability to click right into the bookmark.

Create static lists of bookmarks grouped by categories.

## Level 2

Having a static list of bookmarks is an easy, performant way to view your bookmarks, but it’s probably not the easiest way to manage your bookmarks.

Use a database to manage the bookmarks. Create a form to add new bookmarks and add the ability to remove bookmarks.

## Level 3

Having a list of bookmarks is great, but we might not necessarilly want to go through all of the steps to add it each time we want to add a bookmark. We want someting easy with one or very few clicks.

Create a bookmarklet to easily add a new bookmark.
