## Brief

Puzzles are a fun way to take a piece of art or a familiar photo and turn it into a game. Taking the time to fit each piece leaves you with a rewarding feeling on that last piece.

## Level 1

A puzzle at it’s core leaves a bunch of pieces in an illogical order that you need to put back in the right place to solve. Making sure each piece is in the right place is important to solving the challenge of finishing the picture.

Create a basic puzzle of an image made up of divided squares in the wrong order and place.

## Level 2

Part of the fun of puzzles is the ability to pick an image out that you’re interested in or even personalize it to something you enjoy.

Add the ability to upload a custom image that is used for the puzzle pieces.

## Level 3

Real life puzzle pieces are complex. They have sockets and knobs that intricately fit with each other to make up a larger picture.

Configure the puzzle so each piece has randomized knobs and sockets that fit the adjacent pieces to make up an image.
