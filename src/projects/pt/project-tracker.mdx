## Brief

Project development can be tough to keep track of, especially when working on a team. There are a lot of moving pieces, typically a lot of details, and you want to be able to manage all of those pieces as they come up so you don’t lose track.

## Level 1

The first step of keeping track of work is to be able to create new tickets and easily view them somewhere.

Create an interface that you can submit a new task to be completed for a project and view all tasks in a list.

## Level 2

Typically work tasks involve a lot more than a title. There’s a lot of context for complex problems that you need to capture inside of the ticket so those details don’t get lost and you understand the problem when coming back to it.

Add the ability to include a description on each task. Bonus: include the ability to add acceptance criteria to satisfy the requirements of a ticket.

## Level 3

Depending on the complexity of the project, the task list can easily get huge and overwhelming to try to keep up with. Categorizing tasks is a good way to manage groups of work and prioritize what you need to get done.

Add the ability to tag each task with a category and view only the tasks of each category.
