## Brief

Stocks are all about investment and understanding the performance of your investments is important to making future decisions. This knowledge could be the difference between a huge financial loss or a huge gain.

## Level 1

To understand the performance, you need the to see the data that shows how well a particular stock is doing.

Create a table that shows historical data of several tech stocks.

## Level 2

Loading a bunch of data in a table isn’t always the easiest way to understand the bigger picture. Often, charts are a tool that can show trends in data.

Create a dashboard of charts that display metrics for key performance indicators.

## Level 3

Even though the charts are great for a high level view, being able to “drill down” into the data is helpful if you want to understand more about a particular chart or sample of data.

Link each chart to a page that provides raw, in depth data for that performance indicator.
