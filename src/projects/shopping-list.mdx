## Brief

Whether or not we’re physically going to the store to get them, we all need groceries. That includes things like snacks, drinks, or the different items we’d need for a recipe. Having a shopping list is a good way to remember what we need.

## Level 1

The goal of a shopping list is to be able to add items and check them off once they’re found or purchased. This helps keep track of what we need and what we already have.

Create an app that allows you to add items to a list and mark them as done.

## Level 2

Sometimes when you’re adding something to your shopping list, you want a specific brand that might be confusing to find. Having a photo or description can help explain what you need.

Add the ability to add a photo to a list item or a description.

## Level 3

We’re not always the person who goes to the grocery store and gets the things we need for the week, maybe its a roommate or a loved one. Being able to share the list is helpful to make sure that person knows what all you need from the store.

Add the ability to share the list with another person.
