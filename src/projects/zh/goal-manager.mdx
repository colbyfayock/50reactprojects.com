## Brief

Goals are a great way to help us set a challenge that we want to push ourselves to reach. Further, making those goals public is a way to help keep accountable to others and gain support from the community.

## Level 1

To get started with goals, you need to have them. If you don’t already have some, take some time to think about it, but ultimately, these will be your public goals.

Create a list of goals and put them on your website.

## Level 2

Your goals are public but they’re a pain to keep track of. Every progress update requires a code change and manually updating the UI.

Add your goals to Airtable and use the API to dynamically request your list of goals.

## Level 3

Showing your goals is a great first step, but people want to know how you’re doing. How can you keep yourself accountable and show the world your progress?

Add a field to Airtable that tracks progress of each goal and show that progress status on your website.
