## Brief

StackOverflow is developer gold in that it’s an endless source of development questions that acts a wiki for errors you might encounter with your work. The question and answer format allows people to ask for help with a specific issue and get answers that are rated by other people for helpfulness.

## Level 1

Question and answer websites begin with a single thing — a question. This question is what opens up the door for others to help you solve your problem.

Add a form that creates a new question with a page and categorizes it with tags.

## Level 2

In order to get that help, we need a way for people to help answer it. Having an additional form on the question page lets people submit their answers right along with that question.

Create a form on the question page that allows people to answer the question.

## Level 3

Not all answers are the same. Some people might be genuinely trying to help, some might not know what they’re talking about, and others might simply be trolling. Having a rating system allows the best answer to move to the top.

Add up and down arrows that allow people to upvote and downvote answers.
