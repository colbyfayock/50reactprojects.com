## Brief

YouTube playlists are a great way to collect videos with a bigger theme whether it’s your own videos or someone else’s. It can help people focus on a particular topic like a particular set of tutorials.

## Level 1

The great thing about YouTube, is they make it easy to embed their player. This lets us easily add a playlist to any page.

Create a page that embeds a playlist using YouTube’s player.

## Level 2

When using YouTube’s player, you don’t get much control over the look and feel. The good news, is they have an API that lets us get information about a playlist so we can use it on our page.

Fetch the YouTube playlist using the YouTube API and display the results on a page with links to each video.

## Level 3

Linking to YouTube helps let people easily watch a video, but that takes them away from your website. How can we let people watch the videos while avoiding them navigating away?

Add an autoplaying embed of a video to the page when someone selects a video.
