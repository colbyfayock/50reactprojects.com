## Brief

Flash cards are great way to learn a heap of information in a short period of time. It helps engage your brain with active recall to help as you work through the cards.

## Level 1

Having a good list of questions, phrases, or keywords along with the answers is important to setting up a good deck of flash cards. Setting up a mechanism to hide the answer until we try to answer it ourselves is important to the tool.

Create a list of questions and answers where the answer for each question is hidden until you click a button.

## Level 2

While being able to go through a list of questions is helpful, part of the reason flash cards are effective is because you can focus on one at a time as you move through the deck.

Update the layout of the list of questions and answers so that only a single question and answer pair shows as once. You can also present this as a card like a physical flash card.

## Level 3

Once you’ve correctly answered a question on a flash card and feel confident about it, you can typically set a card aside.

Add the ability to mark each question as “done” when moving through the cards to temporarily remove it from the full “deck” of flash cards.
