## Brief

Websites and apps of all types and sizes can be difficult to navigate with all of the information available. Adding search to a website is a common way to let people sort through the piles of content to find what they’re looking for.

## Level 1

Adding a search form with an input is a basic way to provide search capabilities to a website. Coupling that with narrowing down results from that query helps people find what they need.

Add a search form with an input to an existing website or application and use Fuse.js to search through a list of content that’s available on your project.

## Level 2

Using search alone might be too broad. Having lots of content can only narrow down results so far with a keyword.

Add filter options that allow someone to select categorizations or labels that actively filter the content when selected.

## Level 3

As websites get larger, so does its content. It doesn’t always make sense to include a huge list of content right on the page to search with.

Create a serverless function that loads an index file of all available content that uses the existing Fuse.js search to return results as an API request.
