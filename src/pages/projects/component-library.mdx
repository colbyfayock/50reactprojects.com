## Brief

You work for a large scale ecommerce website that sells music, video games, and movies. Your team wants consistent and reusable components across the website, so your assignment is to create a component library to support the project.

## Level 1

The most visually appealing way to display a collection of media is to use the poster or album artwork in an easy-to-use way like a grid.

Create a new component library with Storybook.js that includes the following base components:

- Poster: a single media item represented by its artwork
- Poster Grid: a grid of Posters
- Media Details: a media item’s metadata including Poster

## Level 2

Maintaining a component library includes making sure the components always work. To do this, we can use snapshot testing to automatically test our components.

Use the Storybook add-on StoryShots to add snapshot testing.

## Level 3

The purpose of building a component library is to use it in a project. Using your newly created component library, create a new React app using your favorite framework that shows the your store’s available music, video games, and music (or your favorites of each).
