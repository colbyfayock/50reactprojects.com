## Brief

You’re looking for a new job in the tech world. Every company  asks for a resume. You also think it’s a good idea to make it available publicly and a great way to do that is to demonstrate your development skills by creating a resume website.

## Level 1

The most important information on a resume is your contact information, skills, and work experience or education.

Create a new website that provides a way for a potential employer to contact you and a list of all of your skills and relevant experience.

## Level 2

When companies look for new candidates, they also like to know a little bit about who they are as a person.

Update your resume website to include links to social accounts that show your interests and include personalized touches that represent you as a person.

## Level 3

You like to work on code on your free time. You’ve created some open source projects or at least have contributed to some.

Update your resume website to include links to GitHub projects to show what you’re working on.

Bonus: make it automatically update sorted by star count.
