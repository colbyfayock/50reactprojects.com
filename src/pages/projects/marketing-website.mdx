</ProjectHeader>

<ProjectContent>

## Brief

The marketing team for the company you work for just launched a new product. They need a detailed marketing plan that includes a website and landing page dedicated to driving people to learn about the product and ultimately purchase it.

## Level 1

Having a website is a great way to showcase a product with the ability to provide as many details as possible.

Create a new website that highlights the great features of the product and provides in-depth information about each feature. The pages should include:

* Homepage with photograph and high level overview
* Feature pages linked from homepage with more details

<LoginRequired>

## Level 2

Just because you made a website, doesn’t automatically mean people will purchase the product.

Create a landing page as part of the marketing website that drives people to sign up with a form for more information.

## Level 3

Ultimately people need to purchase or sign up for the product and to do that, they need a way to contact the sales team.

Create a new page with a form that will allow people to contact the company if interested in the product. Include a “Call to Action” link at the bottom of every page on the website except for the contact page itself that links to the contact page.
