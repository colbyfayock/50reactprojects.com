## Brief

People have different reading preferences. Whether it’s because of the time of day or just generally what they prefer, being able to switch between light mode and dark mode helps personalize the usability of a website or app.

## Level 1

A good way of adding light mode or dark mode is to have a button that lets someone toggle back and forth between the mode. Once changed, the colors of the page should change to match that person’s preference.

Add a toggle that allows a person to switch between light mode and dark mode that changes the color scheme.

## Level 2

Having the ability to switch between light mode and dark mode is handy, but can be a pain if you have to change it on every page. Having that setting persist page to page helps improve people’s experience on a project.

Store the light mode or dark mode preference to preserve the configuration page to page.

## Level 3

Having a light mode and dark mode is helpful for enhancing someone’s experience, but what if they don’t like your dark mode styles? Having options of different themes, like a code editor, can help personalize someone’s experience even further.

Add another color scheme that can be used as a style mode.
