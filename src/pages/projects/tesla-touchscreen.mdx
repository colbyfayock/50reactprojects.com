</ProjectHeader>

<ProjectContent>

## Brief

There are a lot of features bundled with a Tesla that make people excited, but one aspect that’s relatable to developers is the touchscreen panel at the heart of the car’s user experience. Similar to an app we might use on the web or our phones, it has user activated controls for things like maps and music.

## Level 1

Part of what makes an app-like experience is the ability to easily change between different screens providing different context. While we might be using our map’s navigation, we may want to switch to our car’s settings panel or browse around for music (when the car is stopped of course).

Add a tabbed interface that allows someone to navigate between different screens.

## Level 2

When driving, usually you’re trying to arrive at a destination. Having a map helps you know where to go.

Add a map screen that allows someone to add a point of interest with a marker to the map.

## Level 3

Most people like to listen to something when they’re in the car. Some like music, others audiobooks, but we can provide a player for people to enjoy what they want in the car.

Add an audio player screen to play music.
