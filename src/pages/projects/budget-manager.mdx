## Brief

Managing finances is hard. Keeping track of everthing you’ve purcahsed includes lots of math that nobody wants to do. Plus, you might not be willing to give a web company all of your financial data to do it for you.

## Level 1

The most common way of looking at financial data is a table. It’s a good way to visually sort through large amounts of data using columns to add up numbers.

Create an editable table that you can add expenses as rows.

## Level 2

Like anything else, having a static website where we manage features in the code is usable and performant, but maybe not the easiest way to manage it.

Add your budget to Google Sheets and use the Sheets API to access the data.

## Level 3

Using tables is a common way to look at data, but sometimes you want a simple overview instead of having to pick through each row and figure it out yourself.

Create a dashboard of simple statistics and information that you would need for a quick look.
