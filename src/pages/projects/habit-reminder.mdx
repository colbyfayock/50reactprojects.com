## Brief

Habits are hard to create. Maybe itâ€™s fixing your posture or trying to drink some more water, having a tool that can remind you every so often can go a long way to helping you develop that habit.

## Level 1

Setting up a reminder for a habit is usually based on time. We can focus on one habit at a time and create a timer that will send us a reminder every so often.

Create a timer that sends a recurring notification based on a selected time interval.

## Level 2

Most of us probably have a few things we want to try to develop a habit for, so having a single timer can prove challenging to develop them all.

Add the ability to manage multiple timers with unique labels and time intervals.

## Level 3

Ultimately developing a habit means we want to improve on something and tracking our progress can help motivate us towards reaching a goal.

Add the ability to make a habit as done and track the progress of completed habits.
