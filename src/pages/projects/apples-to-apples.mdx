<ProjectContent>

## Brief

Apples to Apples describes itself as “a party game for horrible people”. The game involves a deck of cards where one type of card presents a fill-in-the-blank phrase with other cards that are meant to fill in those phrases.

## Level 1

The game revolves around the deck of cards with two types. In order to play, we’ll want the ability to choose between two different types.

Create a deck of cards with the two card types that allow you to cycle through the different options.

## Level 2

While everyone uses a single fill-in-the-blank card, everyone playing the game gets a few of their own word or phrase cards.

Add the ability to assign groups of cards to others people playing the game.

## Level 3

Part of the fun with Apples to Apples is the funny phrases that end up coming up with the mixing of words and phrases. That’s a perfect opportunity to share with friends!

Add the ability to save funny matches to someone’s device or share them on social media.
