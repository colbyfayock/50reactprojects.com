## Brief

Being able to showcase your work is a great way to help others understand how you think and learn about the experiences you’ve had along the way. This is especially great for job seekers who need to stand out among others.

## Level 1

Showing the various projects you worked on help a potential employer or collaborator know what types of projects you’ve worked on.

Create a page that includes a list of some of the best projects you’ve worked on.

## Level 2

Knowing what you worked on is helpful, but being able to help someone understand the context is even better.

Add project images and details for each project.

## Level 3

To fully understand your thought process, providing case studies can help walk someone through your decisions and challenges that led you to the finished project.

Add case studies for each project that details the project process and challenges.
