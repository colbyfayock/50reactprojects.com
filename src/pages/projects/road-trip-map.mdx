## Brief

Road trips are a lot of fun, but itâ€™s hard to visualize exactly the route you take. How can you easily show the full route and customize it with pictures of your trip?

## Level 1

Using a custom map is a great way to show the route of a trip with the benefit of being able to customize it any way you want.

Create a mapping app that shows the route of a road trip.

## Level 2

Showing the route of the trip is fun, but what places did you stop at along the way? Was there anything interesting about those stops?

Add a list of destinations that includes a little information about each stop.

## Level 3

The map has a lot of cool destinations that make out to be a fun road trip, but what experiences did you have?

Add pictures to each destination from your trip or pictures of places you want to visit.
