## Brief

With the rise of Slack and Discord, people have swarmed to online communities for a place to chat and interact with others who share the same experiences. This can be great, but having a little robot guidance can help

## Level 1

People might not ever notice a bot, but what if someone tried to interact with it?

Create a bot and configure it to respond to a message when sent to a chat.

## Level 2

We want people to feel welcome when they join our community. Having a welcome message is a great way to give people a little bit of information about the community.

Create a welcome message that gets sent to new members of the community when joining.

## Level 3

Not only do we want people to feel welcome, we want people to abide by a code of conduct. Itâ€™s important to create safe areas where everyone feels welcome.

Require people to accept the welcome message with an emoji before being allowed to enter the community.
