## Brief

Frogger is a classic video game where you have a frog that needs to get to the other side of a road without being hit by traffic (cars). It can be challenging as you have to get the timing and the movements just right to survive.

## Level 1

The idea behind Frogger is that the player controls the character’s movement. They need to move through each layer of the space (the road) to get to the other side.

Create a game where the player needs to move a chicken around objects on the road to get to the other side.

## Level 2

Let’s make this more challenging. Moving around stationary objects isn’t too bad, but what if they were moving?

Make each object that the chicken needs to avoid move horizontally in their “lanes”.

## Level 3

Now that it’s challenging, we want to have more levels. And not only do we want to have more levels, we want to make them more fun.

Add a few more levels and take some time to update the chicken and other game objects to something fun. Try adding some sound effects between when the chicken moves, gets hit by something (oh no!), or if they successfuly cross the road!
